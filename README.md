#Andrew's Electronic Load

This is a project to build a programmable electronic load. Currently it's rated for about 2A max but that could potentially be upgraded.

##Status

Currently, the project is in software development. The hardware is all done, though mostly untested. Software is coming along well though, and a beta version should hopefully be done soon. 

##Features

There are a number of features that will eventually make it into this project. The planned software versions are as follows:

### Version 0:

  * Navigation of the display via front panel knob
  * Able to set desired current
  * Display shows current, voltage, and power

### Version 1:

  * Specify cutoff voltage, for battery testing
  * Specify constant current or constant power
  * Monitor runtime, for battery testing

### Version 2:

  * Implement datalogging to SD card
  * (potential) place load profiles on SD card, to vary load over test duration
